# Sea-of-Destiny---DE-Diomes-Edition-
Morrowind Mod - My version of Clone's old Sea of Destiny, moved to the far north east of Vvardenfell and TR
A Sea of Destiny - Dio's personal version
===========================================================

WIP not even close to being done. You can take a look if you want, but there will be bugs. 
This isn't the way I wanted to upload this, but it is what it is.
- I'm sick, uploaded just in case.
========================================================
How to Install -

Use WryeMash and make sure to "Install Missing" files only.
========================================================
To Start Mod -

talk to Qasrin in Ebonheart, Six Fishes for travel
========================================================
Bugs - Yes!

Quests go nowhere
Dialogue says weird things it shouldn't
Some meshes aren't finished
Cells you can't access

If you want bugs, this mod checks all the lists!

========================================================
Compatiblity Issues -
None, just keep towards the top of load order and let other mods override this one.
==============================================================
Current Progress -
I haven't updated this chart in a few months, but this is what I use to keep track of things.
Also some things like Dialogue, Factions, and Quests, are a little deceiving because percentage includes planning text and foundational edits that can't really be noticed in game.

Credits-

Lots of people

Unfortunately I'm a little incapacitated at the moment.
Sorry, hopefully I sort get the chance to sort this out better one day.

Jman0WarS - Original Privateer's Hold Meshes that I edited into true 3D tileset

Melchior Dahrk - I think it was some edits to nDibs trees, mist meshes, OMG meshes, and maybe water nif files,.. sry 

Shannon - Egyptian Tileset- Simon 'sock' oCallahan for the textures, Barabus for the meshes. I re-did UV maps and fixed holes/simplified meshes
===============================================================

Permission -
Well, I'm not dead yet so I hope to work on this more in the future. I'd prefer that you don't re-post this mod on the Nexus or ModDB, but if you don't see me active in a years time... well I guess things didn't go as planned, and you can do whatever. 

Permission to use mesh/textures -
Anything in a folder that includes the word Dio is fair game. I made those, so go ahead and use/edit however you want. Everything else, you'll have to figure out permissions yourself.

Also, Clone included a lot of stuff by other people and I'm not entirely sure he had permission to use. That being so, I don't think I can just say 'go ahead and use/modify anything' like I normally would.
