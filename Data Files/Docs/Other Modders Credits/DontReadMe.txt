Dongle's Water Object Pack
-------------------------

A Collection of Objects with Animated Water for Morrowind

-------------------------

This is a collection of animated water meshes for world builders to use
in Morrowind. No playable mod is included in this pack, nor any new
textures, just .nif files. Use 'em anyway you like.

-------------------------

Everything has an animated water effect. Most are the same animation as
the stock game's ocean water. It looks exactly like the ocean, if you
turn your pixel shaders off.

-------------------------

Items named beginning with "DG-WO" are furniture-type objects. There are
three water-holding cisterns, these are modified from the stock game's
wells. (It is not possible to do a well, with a very deep hole in this
game) There is also a half-barrel filled with water, again a stock game
mesh with water added. There are three Imperial Pools. These are an unused
mesh from the game CD I've added water to. The numbers in the names of the
pool meshes correspond to the depth of the water. New to v1.1 are; A rock pool,
a mudcave-type rock with a depression on top holding some water. And finally;
a lilypad. The top part of the lily uses 3D geometry instead of the 2D-plane
plus alpha the stock lilies do. This is because the stock lilypads have trouble
with clashing alpha channels when placed in my water meshes.

I've made two brand new meshes for this pack, a wooden bathtub and washing
basin. Both are filled with water (duh).

There are 11 objects with animated water in total.

-------------------------

You can add any of these in the editor as statics, they will animate fine.
No script is necessary to start the animation. They can be used as activators
as well. One neat trick would be to add them as activators and add a script to
play a water sound. The animation will not play in the editor's preview window,
you will only see the animation in-game. There are no X_.nif, or X_.kf files,
only a single _.nif file is needed for each mesh.

Anytime I do animated textures the .nifs will confuse the NifTexture skinning app.
To re-skin these you will need to hex-edit them.

-------------------------

You are free to use this in any Morrowind project you wish. Asking ahead is not
necessary. Giving credit is not necessary, although you are welcome to if you wish.

If you wish to modify this in any way, ie edit the mesh or the texturing, you
may do so. Please credit yourself with the final product and not me. Also please
change the filenames to avoid conflicts with mods that use the unaltered files.

No additional usage restrictions may be added.

Please do not port for use outside of The Elder Scrolls series.

You may add these to your fan site for download.
Please keep the original .zip file intact with this ReadMe.
