Requirements
Find what you need to play Sea of Destiny.
 
 
 
Game
Since this is a mod, you will need to buy the retail game: Morrowind.

Game Expansions
There has been 2 expansions released for Morrowind. You only need this one: Tribunal. 
 
Installing
How to get Sea of Destiny on your computer.
 
 
 
Process
You have pretty done all the work for installing SoD when running the exe file that you downloaded. To make sure you installed the files in the correct place, follow the steps listed below.

Go into your "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files" directory. This may be different depending on where you installed Morrowind. In the "Data Files" folder there should be a file named "Sea-of-Destiny.esm" in there. If there is not one, you have installed SoD wrong. Make sure when you run the exe file, you click to install to your "Data Files" folder. 
 
Playing
How to get playing Sea of Destiny ingame.
 
 
 
Activate
1. Run your Morrowind launcher from your "Start" bar and then click "All Programs."
2. Click the "Data Files" button
3. Make sure the following files are checked before running SoD: Sea-of-Destiny.esm, sodpatch1.esp.

Ingame
After activating the files, load up Morrowind like you would normally. I highly recommend you start a new game to play SoD. Next steps are listed below.
1. Go to the city of Balmora.
2. There is a npc named Loth Mayor that is standing on the road going out of Balmora to Caldera, talk to him.
3. He will transport you to DaggerSoul under his travel options.
4. After you have teleported there, head to the DaggerSoul Council building and talk to the king upstairs to start the main storyline of Sea of Destiny.

Warning
If you are using the official Siege at Firemoth plugin, disable it before you use SoD. Other plugins you use may conflict with SoD also. So be careful on what you run with SoD.

Errors
If you come upon any errors when loading Morrowind, use the following steps to avoid them.
1. Go to "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind"
2. Open the "Morrowind.ini" with Notepad
3. Under the ";Test TES 0=morrowind.esm"
4. Add the following "AllowYesToAll=1" (Without the quotes)
5. Next time you run Morrowind, getting past the errors will be easy because this command lets you click a yes to all button. So only one click instead of clicking through numerous errors.
